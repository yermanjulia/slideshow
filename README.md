# Slideshow Application

This project is a web-based slideshow application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The application presents a set of slides in two sections: a sidebar section and a main slide section. The sidebar contains the navigation controls (up and down buttons) and titles for the slides, while the main slide section displays large background images. Users can navigate through the slides using the up and down buttons, and the slides are animated with a smooth scrolling effect when transitioning between them.

## Files

The project consists of three files:

1. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file containing the slideshow application's structure.

2. `styles.css`: This is the CSS file that handles the styling of the application, including the positioning and animations of the slides and the appearance of the up and down buttons.

3. `app.js`: This is the JavaScript file containing the application's logic. It handles the events of clicking the up and down buttons and calculates the sliding movement of the slides.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to start the application.
2. Use the "up" and "down" buttons on the sidebar to navigate the slides.
3. Enjoy the smooth transition effect between the slides.

Please note that the number of slides and their contents (titles and images) can be adjusted in the `index.html` and `styles.css` files.
